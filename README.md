# Hi there, I'm Junn Akita (Akky) 👋

**Freelance Backend Engineer** based in Tokyo, Japan.

Building and maintaining production web applications since the late '90s.
Specialized in **long-running systems that must survive for years** — not demos.

I handle everything from backend logic to server infrastructure, deployment automation, and incident recovery.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 🏠 Born and raised in **Tokyo, Japan**
- 💼 **Freelance Engineer** — backend development & server infrastructure
- 📜 Certified: **Second Class Information Technology Engineer** (情報処理2種) — a classic
- 🔧 50+ years of combined uptime between me and my servers (est. 1974)

---

## 🔥 Philosophy

- **Production first** — code that doesn't ship doesn't matter
- **Stability over hype** — proven tech beats trendy tech
- **Automation over manual work** — if I do it twice, I script it
- Systems should survive **10+ years**
- *"If it breaks at 3am, I can fix it."*

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

In 2025, I fully transitioned to **Claude Code** as my primary development environment.
PHPStorm hasn't been opened once since — a decision I never looked back on.

- ⚡ Dramatically reduced development time across all projects
- 🏗️ Built complete management systems in days that would have taken weeks
- 🔧 Migrated entire web applications between AWS accounts using AI-assisted workflows
- 🛡️ Custom tooling: automated deployment, server orchestration, multi-site monitoring
- 🧠 My AI partners: **くらりん** (Claude) & **くろ** (ChatGPT)

> "Claude fell? Work stopped too." — My daily reality since 2025

## 📈 My Dev Evolution

```
1990s: C → Perl → "the internet is cool"
2000s: PHP3/4 → Self-hosted everything → MySQL warrior
2010s: Laravel → AWS → "infrastructure is my thing"
2020s: Docker → AI-first dev → "I don't open my IDE anymore"
```

## 🎮 Fun Facts

- 🕹️ FGO & Girls' Frontline 2 player
- 💸 Invested heavily in AI dev tools (worth every yen)
- 📟 Once migrated 30 years of TeraTerm configs to MobaXterm by reverse-engineering the password encryption
- 💥 Survived a production DB wipe (Laravel's `RefreshDatabase` trait on prod — never again)
- 🖥️ Managing 6+ production servers solo, including some that have been running since the 2000s
- 🎯 *"I design systems assuming someone will break them."*
